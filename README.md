# Custom DistilBERT Model for Semantic Classification

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a custom DistilBERT model with a 768-dimensional hidden layer, tailored for semantic classification tasks. A semantic classification model is designed to understand and interpret the meaning of sequences of words, sentences, or phrases in natural language processing (NLP). These models are trained to recognize patterns in text that convey semantic information, enabling them to classify or categorize text based on its underlying meaning or context.

This model, a super lightweight transformer, stands out for its balance between light compute requirements and robust functionality, making it an excellent choice for developers seeking efficiency without sacrificing performance.

## Applications and Use Cases

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotional tone behind a sequence of words, used to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions and emotions expressed within an online mention.
- **Topic Categorization**: Automatically classifying text documents into one or more predefined categories based on their content.
- **Intent Detection**: Identifying the intention behind texts, which is especially useful in understanding user commands in chatbots and virtual assistants.
- **Spam Detection**: Filtering out unwanted or unsolicited messages to improve the user experience on digital platforms.

## Development Approach

I set out to tweak its hyperparameters, aiming to enhance its suitability for semantic analysis tasks. The goal was clear: to create a variant that maintains the essence of DistilBERT but with optimized performance for our specific needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Intel Developer Cloud Notebook**: Chosen for its robust computational capabilities, especially with GPU support for PyTorch models.
- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.
- **TRANSFORMERS Library from Hugging Face**: Provides thousands of pre-trained models to perform tasks on texts such as classification, information extraction, question answering, and more.

The Intel Developer Cloud and Jupyter Lab environments offer the computational power and interactive development space critical for our experiments.
